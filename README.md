# SnakeGame

## This is my first big code that I've done at the University, it helped me a lot to develop basic C programming knowledge.

#### Compile example: 'gcc -o game SnakeGame.c'
#### Run example: './game Casos/Testes/normais/1'

##### 'How to play' instructions are inside the game as you run it, have fun! :)
