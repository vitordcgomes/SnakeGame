# SnakeGame

## Description: A basic snake game played on the terminal. The different maps/levels of the game are provided in the 'Casos.zip' paste.

### This is my first big code that I've done at the University, it helped me a lot to develop basic C programming knowledge.

#### Compile example: 'gcc -o game SnakeGame.c'
#### Run example: './game Casos/Testes/normais/1'

##### 'How to play' instructions are inside the game as you run it, have fun! :)
